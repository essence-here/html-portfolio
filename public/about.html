<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  My name is Essence Graves and I am studying to be a software engineer. I currently hold an associates degree with an emphasis in business, and am currently enrolled in the following tech related curriculum:
  <ul>
    <li>Angela Yu's Complete Web Development Curriculum -   <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/?couponCode=LEARNNOWPLANS">Udemy</a>
    </li>

    <li>Free Code Camp Curriculum - 
        <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn">Free Code Camp</a>
      </li>

    <li>Object-Oriented Design, Intro to Python + Python Lab - 
        <a href="https://www.mtsac.edu/">Mt. San Antonio College</a>
    </li>

  </ul>
  It has been a pleasure learning the foundational aspects of html, and I am eager to master CSS and Java Script.
</p>
  
<p>
  It is my goal to offer my skills as a software engineer to a small-medium sized company whose culture promotes continuous learning. I also wish to work at a company that allows its developers to work from anywhere in the world, remotely.
</p>

<p>
Another goal of mine is to complete my bachelors degree in software engineering at <a href="https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/software-engineering-bachelors-program.html">Western Governors University</a> after this last semester at Mt. SAC.
</p>

<p>
  I am so grateful for the resources that have allowed me to self-teach myself some of these concepts because they have primed me for the courses that I listed above, and have also allowed me to learn a skill that I can share with my little cousins, and son when he becomes of age. 
</p>

<p>
  Thank you for taking the time to read about me, and please, feel free to keep up with me as I learn more and add more projects to my portfolio.
</p>

<p>Until next time!</p>

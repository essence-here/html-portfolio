<h1>Essence's Favorite | 2 T.V Shows & 1 Movie</h1>
<h2>Top 3 Favorites of <em><strong>All Time.</strong></em></h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Office</h3>
<p>This should be classified as a <em>classic</em> at this point. Quirky, simple, and awkward with characters you'll grow to love.</p>

<h3>The Count of Monte Cristo</h3>
<p>The BEST revenge movie. Wonderful actors, with a story to match. </p>

<h3>The O.A</h3>
<p>This show transcends the fabric of T.V show reality. The depth of it's beauty caught me by surprise. Excuse the cliche, but my words are not doing it justice.</p>
